## MODEL HAMILTONIAN:

gamma         = 3.91504469e2        # float : meV*nm
Egap          = 1311.79             # float : meV
r0            = 4.51                # float : nm
mc            = 0                   # float : conduction band effective mass
mv            = 0                   # float : valence band effective mass
alpha_option  = zero                # str   : options: (zero, masses, corrected)
epsilon       = 1                   # float : effective dielectric constant

## BSE EXCHANGE:

exchange      = 0                   # int   : 0 = False, 1 = True
d_chosen      = 0.6                 # float : Chose a value in the interval [0.6, 0.65] nm


## K-SPACE:

L_k             = 5                 # float : the discretized k-space limits: k_x(y) âˆˆ [-L,L]
n_mesh          = 101               # int   : quantity of points in each direction
n_sub           = 101               # int   : quantity of points in each of the submesh direction
submesh_radius  = 50                # int   : in number of sites; radius of the region where the submesh will be considered


## SAVING OPTIONS:

n_rec_states    = 1000              # int : Number of states to be recorded
