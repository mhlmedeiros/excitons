## MODEL HAMILTONIAN:

Ham           = H2x2                # chosen Hamiltonian has to be a class in 'hamiltonians.py'
gamma         = 3.91504469e2        # meV*nm
Egap          = 1311.79             # meV
r0            = 4.51                # nm
mc            = 0                   # conduction band effective mass
mv            = 0                   # valence band effective mass
alpha_option  = zero                # options: (zero, masses, corrected)
epsilon       = 1                   # effective dielectric constant


## K-SPACE:

L_k             = 5       # the discretized k-space limits: k_x(y) âˆˆ [-L,L]
n_mesh          = 101     # quantity of points in each direction
n_sub           = 101     # quantity of points in each of the submesh direction
submesh_radius  = 50      # in number of sites; radius of the region where the submesh will be considered


## SAVING OPTIONS:

n_rec_states    = 1000    # Number of states to be recorded
